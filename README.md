# Hermeris
The official documentation for the Hermeris Bot

## Preface
***Refer to the following steps to add Hermeris to your server:***
* Go to the Hermeris Website and select the appropriate invite button to add Hermeris. 
* Alternatively, click here to add Hermeris.

*After adding Hermeris, you should receive a welcome message in the first text channel of the server.*

Hermeris will require a few minutes to reload its extensions and add the guildâ€™s commands for use. If the above-shown embed does not appear and the bot appears offline, it could be due to the following reasons:
* Server outage (please contact AureateHalo in such a scenario)
* Downtime for debugging and upgrades (visit the AureateHalo website for updates)

Occasionally, Hermeris has to be turned off due to the above-mentioned reasons. In some cases, assuming that Hermeris was successfully added to the server, it will send an embed in the first text channel, providing vital information about the shutdown.

As Hermeris a free to use the bot and relies entirely on donations for its hosting, downtimes and performance issues may occur at times. While there is no perfect solution to this, donations always make Hermeris more powerful and robust.
Furthermore, beta versions of Hermeris are highly unstable and should not be used on large servers. They are subjected to frequent shutdowns and connection issues. Users should only use a beta version of Hermeris for testing and experimental purposes or on smaller servers. A beta version of Hermeris may leave any large servers which hinder its performance. Hermeris does not interact through Private Channels. Only /status, /manual, and /invite can be used in Private Channels.
